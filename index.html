                    <h1>ATM</h1>
                    <p>Automated teller machines for cash withdrawal.ATMs, short for Automated Teller Machines, are self-service banking terminals that allow customers to perform various financial transactions without the need for human assistance. While commonly associated with banks, ATMs are also frequently found in supermarkets and other retail locations.

                        In a supermarket setting, ATMs provide customers with convenient access to cash withdrawal services, offering an additional level of convenience during their shopping experience. These machines are typically located near the entrance or checkout area for easy accessibility.
                        
                        Using an ATM in a supermarket is straightforward. Customers insert their bank card into the machine and follow the prompts on the screen to select the desired transaction, such as withdrawing cash, checking an account balance, or transferring funds between accounts. They then enter their personal identification number (PIN) to authenticate the transaction and complete the process.
